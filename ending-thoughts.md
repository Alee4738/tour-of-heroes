# Spew terms I should "know" from the angular Tour of Heroes tutorial

I was comfortable in the beginning. I think I can get used to HttpClient and RoutingModule. I am still shaky with rxjs, observables, and http requests. 

* Module
* Component
* Template
* declarations
* providers
* services
* Dependency injection
* imports
* exports
* @NgModule

* EventEmitter
* Two-way binding
* event binding
* interpolation

* HttpClientInMemoryWebApi
* HttpClient: get, put, post, delete
* httpOptions

* rxjs
* observable: return multiple times
* subscribe
* pipe
* subject
* rxjs operators: map, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, switchMap, tap
* AsyncPipe

* RoutingModule
* Routes
* paramMap
* redirectTo
* path

* constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
* `myVariable's value: ${myVariable}`

* ng generate component my-component
* ng generate service my-service
* ng generate module routing-module
